## Project Overview
This web application 'One Stop Planner' seeks to address the concerns an everyday commuter might have; route planning, journey time etc.
In this project, we aim to build a web-based one-stop portal for Singaporeans that travel via public transportation or their personal cars. There are many applications out there that provide Singaporeans the timing of their buses to plan their trip and the route of the bus. However, even though there are applications out there that cater to public transportation there is no one stop solution that caters to both public and private transportation. 

## How to Use Our Web Application (for Visitors to our Website)
